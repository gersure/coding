// This is an internal header file used by profiler.cc.  It defines
// the single (inline) function GetPC.  GetPC is used in a signal
// handler to figure out the instruction that was being executed when
// the signal-handler was triggered.
//
// To get this, we use the ucontext_t argument to the signal-handler
// callback, which holds the full context of what was going on when
// the signal triggered.  How to get from a ucontext_t to a Program
// Counter is OS-dependent.
